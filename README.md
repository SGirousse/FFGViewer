GoViewer
========

1. Why
--
A project merging two loves : development and Go. I started that project in parallel of a Master mobile programmation class in order to apply and learn. It could end as a usable app.

2. Usage
--
The main idea is to access FFG information faster (like personal of another players info), to be able to easily add a tournament to your Google Calendar, to follow last news (not only from FFG), etc.
