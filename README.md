GoViewer
========

A project merging two loves : development and Go. I started that project in parallel of a Master mobile programmation class in order to apply and learn. It could end as a usable app.

Description
--
The main idea is to access FFG information faster (like personal of another players info), to be able to easily add a tournament to your Google Calendar, to follow last news (not only from FFG), etc.

Licence

As Github strongly encourage me to add a licence and as I'm a weak spirit :
